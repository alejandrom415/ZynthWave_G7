VC Best Practices
1) No one works in engine, in the same branch, at the same time. If you need to make changes, make your own branch and label it according to what is going to be changed (ex. Animation, Art, Level Layout)
2) When working in engine: enter the "In Engine" voice channel in the team discord.
3) When beginning work in engine: put the time you started, what branch you are in, when you ended, and the name of the commit to Github on the "Engine Logs" text channel in the team discord.
